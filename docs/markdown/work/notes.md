## Agents

### Note 20250123-0730

Agents require the ability to remember past actions, security, handle user feedback, and adapt gracefully. In other words, it is a proper software product that happens to use/integrate a large language model with tool usage to accomplish various tasks.

As AI engineers working at the application layer, this is our job building agents: assemble these pieces into a polished and fully realized product.
