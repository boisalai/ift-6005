Examples of values: 0, 1, 15
Query examples:
# Find products with a high number of unknown ingredients (more than 10):
SELECT code, product_name, unknown_ingredients_n FROM products WHERE unknown_ingredients_n > 10 ORDER BY unknown_ingredients_n DESC LIMIT 50
# Calculate the percentage of products with unknown ingredients:
SELECT ROUND(COUNT(CASE WHEN unknown_ingredients_n > 0 THEN 1 END) * 100.0 / COUNT(*), 2) as percent_with_unknown FROM products WHERE unknown_ingredients_n IS NOT NULL LIMIT 50
# Group products by ranges of unknown ingredients count:
SELECT CASE WHEN unknown_ingredients_n = 0 THEN 'No unknown' WHEN unknown_ingredients_n BETWEEN 1 AND 5 THEN '1-5' WHEN unknown_ingredients_n BETWEEN 6 AND 10 THEN '6-10' ELSE 'More than 10' END as range, COUNT(*) as count FROM products WHERE unknown_ingredients_n IS NOT NULL GROUP BY 1 LIMIT 50

Column: additives_tags
Type: VARCHAR[]
Description: An array of food additives present in the product, using standardized E-number format with 'en:e' prefix. Each element represents one additive (e.g., 'en:e330' for citric acid). Common additives include preservatives, emulsifiers, and acidity regulators.

POTENTIALLY RELEVANT COLUMNS:
The following columns have been identified through semantic search as potentially relevant, 
with their similarity scores (higher means more likely relevant):

Column: additives_tags
Type: VARCHAR[]
Description: An array of food additives present in the product, using standardized E-number format with 'en:e' prefix. Each element represents one additive (e.g., 'en:e330' for citric acid). Common additives include preservatives, emulsifiers, and acidity regulators.
Examples of values: ['en:e330', 'en:e322', 'en:e500'], ['en:e211'], ['en:e330', 'en:e202', 'en:e260', 'en:e951']
Query examples:
# Find the most commonly used additives and their frequency:
WITH unnested AS ( SELECT unnest(additives_tags) as additive FROM products WHERE additives_tags IS NOT NULL ) SELECT additive, COUNT(*) as frequency FROM unnested GROUP BY additive ORDER BY frequency DESC LIMIT 10;
# Find products containing a specific additive (e.g., E330 - Citric acid):
SELECT code, product_name, additives_tags FROM products WHERE array_contains(additives_tags, 'en:e330') LIMIT 1000;
# Count products by number of additives used:
SELECT array_length(additives_tags) as num_additives, COUNT(*) as product_count FROM products WHERE additives_tags IS NOT NULL GROUP BY array_length(additives_tags) ORDER BY num_additives;

Column: unknown_ingredients_n
Type: INTEGER
Description: Count of ingredients in the product that are not recognized or cannot be properly classified in the Open Food Facts database
Examples of values: 0, 1, 15
Query examples:
# Find products with a high number of unknown ingredients (more than 10):
SELECT code, product_name, unknown_ingredients_n FROM products WHERE unknown_ingredients_n > 10 ORDER BY unknown_ingredients_n DESC LIMIT 50
# Calculate the percentage of products with unknown ingredients:
SELECT ROUND(COUNT(CASE WHEN unknown_ingredients_n > 0 THEN 1 END) * 100.0 / COUNT(*), 2) as percent_with_unknown FROM products WHERE unknown_ingredients_n IS NOT NULL LIMIT 50
# Group products by ranges of unknown ingredients count:
SELECT CASE WHEN unknown_ingredients_n = 0 THEN 'No unknown' WHEN unknown_ingredients_n BETWEEN 1 AND 5 THEN '1-5' WHEN unknown_ingredients_n BETWEEN 6 AND 10 THEN '6-10' ELSE 'More than 10' END as range, COUNT(*) as count FROM products WHERE unknown_ingredients_n IS NOT NULL GROUP BY 1 LIMIT 50

Column: ingredients_with_unspecified_percent_n
Type: INTEGER
Description: Counts the number of ingredients in a product that don't have their percentages specified. This metric is important for assessing product transparency and data completeness in ingredient listings.
Examples of values: 5, 44, 271
Query examples:
# Find products with the highest number of unspecified ingredient percentages, which might need attention for transparency improvement:
SELECT code, product_name, ingredients_with_unspecified_percent_n FROM products WHERE ingredients_with_unspecified_percent_n > 50 ORDER BY ingredients_with_unspecified_percent_n DESC LIMIT 1000;
# Analyze the distribution of products based on their number of unspecified ingredients to understand overall transparency levels:
SELECT CASE WHEN ingredients_with_unspecified_percent_n <= 10 THEN '1-10' WHEN ingredients_with_unspecified_percent_n <= 20 THEN '11-20' WHEN ingredients_with_unspecified_percent_n <= 30 THEN '21-30' ELSE 'Over 30' END as range, COUNT(*) as count FROM products WHERE ingredients_with_unspecified_percent_n IS NOT NULL GROUP BY 1 ORDER BY 1;
# Identify products where all ingredients lack percentage specifications, calculated as a ratio of unspecified to total ingredients:
SELECT code, product_name, ingredients_with_unspecified_percent_n, ingredients_n, ROUND(CAST(ingredients_with_unspecified_percent_n AS FLOAT) / NULLIF(ingredients_n, 0) * 100, 2) as unspecified_percentage FROM products WHERE ingredients_with_unspecified_percent_n > 0 AND ingredients_n > 0 ORDER BY unspecified_percentage DESC LIMIT 1000;

Column: ingredients_n
Type: INTEGER
Description: Number of ingredients in a product. Represents the total count of distinct ingredients used in the product's composition. Values range from 0 to 289, with an average of about 17 ingredients per product.
Examples of values: 1, 4, 17
Query examples:
# Find products with ingredient counts above the 90th percentile (complex products):
WITH stats AS ( SELECT PERCENTILE_CONT(0.9) WITHIN GROUP (ORDER BY ingredients_n) as p90 FROM products WHERE ingredients_n IS NOT NULL ) SELECT code, product_name, ingredients_n FROM products, stats WHERE ingredients_n > stats.p90 ORDER BY ingredients_n DESC LIMIT 1000
# Get distribution of products by ingredient count ranges:
SELECT CASE WHEN ingredients_n BETWEEN 0 AND 5 THEN '0-5' WHEN ingredients_n BETWEEN 6 AND 10 THEN '6-10' WHEN ingredients_n BETWEEN 11 AND 20 THEN '11-20' ELSE '21+' END as ingredient_range, COUNT(*) as product_count, ROUND(COUNT(*) * 100.0 / SUM(COUNT(*)) OVER (), 2) as percentage FROM products WHERE ingredients_n IS NOT NULL GROUP BY 1 ORDER BY MIN(ingredients_n)
# Find products with abnormally high or low ingredient counts (potential data quality issues):
WITH stats AS ( SELECT AVG(ingredients_n) as avg_ingredients, STDDEV(ingredients_n) as stddev_ingredients FROM products WHERE ingredients_n IS NOT NULL ) SELECT code, product_name, ingredients_n FROM products, stats WHERE ingredients_n IS NOT NULL AND (ingredients_n = 0 OR ingredients_n > avg_ingredients + 2 * stddev_ingredients) ORDER BY ingredients_n DESC LIMIT 1000

Column: known_ingredients_n
Type: INTEGER
Description: Number of recognized ingredients in a product that match the Open Food Facts ingredients taxonomy. A value of 0 indicates no recognized ingredients, while higher values indicate more complex products with more identified ingredients.
Examples of values: 3, 9, 112
Query examples:
# Find distribution of products by number of known ingredients:
SELECT known_ingredients_n, COUNT(*) as product_count FROM products WHERE known_ingredients_n IS NOT NULL GROUP BY known_ingredients_n ORDER BY known_ingredients_n LIMIT 50
# Find products with unusually high number of ingredients (complex products):
SELECT code, product_name, known_ingredients_n FROM products WHERE known_ingredients_n > 50 ORDER BY known_ingredients_n DESC LIMIT 50
