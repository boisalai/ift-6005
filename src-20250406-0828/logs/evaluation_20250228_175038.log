# Count products by number of additives used:
SELECT array_length(additives_tags) as num_additives, COUNT(*) as product_count FROM products WHERE additives_tags IS NOT NULL GROUP BY array_length(additives_tags) ORDER BY num_additives;

Column: ingredients_with_unspecified_percent_n
Type: INTEGER
Description: Counts the number of ingredients in a product that don't have their percentages specified. This metric is important for assessing product transparency and data completeness in ingredient listings.

POTENTIALLY RELEVANT COLUMNS:
The following columns have been identified through semantic search as potentially relevant, 
with their similarity scores (higher means more likely relevant):

Column: additives_tags
Type: VARCHAR[]
Description: An array of food additives present in the product, using standardized E-number format with 'en:e' prefix. Each element represents one additive (e.g., 'en:e330' for citric acid). Common additives include preservatives, emulsifiers, and acidity regulators.
Examples of values: ['en:e330', 'en:e322', 'en:e500'], ['en:e211'], ['en:e330', 'en:e202', 'en:e260', 'en:e951']
Query examples:
# Find the most commonly used additives and their frequency:
WITH unnested AS ( SELECT unnest(additives_tags) as additive FROM products WHERE additives_tags IS NOT NULL ) SELECT additive, COUNT(*) as frequency FROM unnested GROUP BY additive ORDER BY frequency DESC LIMIT 10;
# Find products containing a specific additive (e.g., E330 - Citric acid):
SELECT code, product_name, additives_tags FROM products WHERE array_contains(additives_tags, 'en:e330') LIMIT 1000;
# Count products by number of additives used:
SELECT array_length(additives_tags) as num_additives, COUNT(*) as product_count FROM products WHERE additives_tags IS NOT NULL GROUP BY array_length(additives_tags) ORDER BY num_additives;

Column: ingredients_original_tags
Type: VARCHAR[]
Description: An array of standardized ingredient tags, typically prefixed with language codes (e.g., 'en:', 'fr:'). Each tag represents a single ingredient in its normalized form, making it easier to search and analyze product compositions. The tags follow the Open Food Facts taxonomy.
Examples of values: ['en:water', 'en:sugar', 'en:carbon-dioxide'], ['en:fortified-wheat-flour', 'en:sugar', 'en:vegetable-oil', 'en:salt'], ['en:milk-chocolate', 'en:sugar', 'en:cocoa-butter', 'en:cocoa-paste', 'en:milk-powder']
Query examples:
# Find the most common ingredients in products and their frequency of use:
SELECT unnest(ingredients_original_tags) as ingredient, COUNT(*) as frequency FROM products WHERE ingredients_original_tags IS NOT NULL GROUP BY ingredient ORDER BY frequency DESC LIMIT 1000;
# Find all products containing a specific ingredient (e.g., sugar):
SELECT code, product_name, ingredients_original_tags FROM products WHERE array_contains(ingredients_original_tags, 'en:sugar') LIMIT 1000;
# Find products with the most ingredients, sorted by ingredient count:
SELECT code, product_name, array_length(ingredients_original_tags) as ingredient_count, ingredients_original_tags FROM products WHERE ingredients_original_tags IS NOT NULL ORDER BY array_length(ingredients_original_tags) DESC LIMIT 1000;

Column: minerals_tags
Type: VARCHAR[]
Description: An array of mineral ingredients found in food products, using the Open Food Facts taxonomy with 'en:' prefix. Includes both simple minerals (like 'en:iron') and specific mineral compounds (like 'en:calcium-chloride'). NULL when no minerals are listed.
Examples of values: ['en:calcium-chloride', 'en:sodium-phosphate', 'en:calcium-sulfate'], ['en:sodium', 'en:potassium', 'en:calcium'], ['en:calcium-carbonate', 'en:magnesium-oxide', 'en:zinc-oxide', 'en:copper-gluconate']
Query examples:
# Find the most common minerals and their frequency in products:
WITH RECURSIVE unnested AS ( SELECT UNNEST(minerals_tags) as mineral FROM products WHERE minerals_tags IS NOT NULL ) SELECT mineral, COUNT(*) as count FROM unnested GROUP BY mineral ORDER BY count DESC LIMIT 50;
# Find products containing both calcium and iron:
SELECT code, product_name, minerals_tags FROM products WHERE minerals_tags IS NOT NULL AND (array_contains(minerals_tags, 'en:calcium') OR array_contains(minerals_tags, 'en:calcium-chloride') OR array_contains(minerals_tags, 'en:calcium-carbonate')) AND (array_contains(minerals_tags, 'en:iron') OR array_contains(minerals_tags, 'en:ferric-orthophosphate')) LIMIT 50;
# Calculate the average number of minerals per product (excluding NULL):
SELECT AVG(array_length(minerals_tags)) as avg_minerals_count, MIN(array_length(minerals_tags)) as min_minerals, MAX(array_length(minerals_tags)) as max_minerals FROM products WHERE minerals_tags IS NOT NULL LIMIT 50;

POTENTIALLY RELEVANT COLUMNS:
The following columns have been identified through semantic search as potentially relevant, 
with their similarity scores (higher means more likely relevant):

Column: ingredients_n
Type: INTEGER
Description: Number of ingredients in a product. Represents the total count of distinct ingredients used in the product's composition. Values range from 0 to 289, with an average of about 17 ingredients per product.
Examples of values: 1, 4, 17
Query examples:
# Find products with ingredient counts above the 90th percentile (complex products):
WITH stats AS ( SELECT PERCENTILE_CONT(0.9) WITHIN GROUP (ORDER BY ingredients_n) as p90 FROM products WHERE ingredients_n IS NOT NULL ) SELECT code, product_name, ingredients_n FROM products, stats WHERE ingredients_n > stats.p90 ORDER BY ingredients_n DESC LIMIT 1000
# Get distribution of products by ingredient count ranges:
SELECT CASE WHEN ingredients_n BETWEEN 0 AND 5 THEN '0-5' WHEN ingredients_n BETWEEN 6 AND 10 THEN '6-10' WHEN ingredients_n BETWEEN 11 AND 20 THEN '11-20' ELSE '21+' END as ingredient_range, COUNT(*) as product_count, ROUND(COUNT(*) * 100.0 / SUM(COUNT(*)) OVER (), 2) as percentage FROM products WHERE ingredients_n IS NOT NULL GROUP BY 1 ORDER BY MIN(ingredients_n)
# Find products with abnormally high or low ingredient counts (potential data quality issues):
WITH stats AS ( SELECT AVG(ingredients_n) as avg_ingredients, STDDEV(ingredients_n) as stddev_ingredients FROM products WHERE ingredients_n IS NOT NULL ) SELECT code, product_name, ingredients_n FROM products, stats WHERE ingredients_n IS NOT NULL AND (ingredients_n = 0 OR ingredients_n > avg_ingredients + 2 * stddev_ingredients) ORDER BY ingredients_n DESC LIMIT 1000

Column: additives_n
Type: INTEGER
Description: Number of additives present in the product. Ranges from 0 (no additives) to 24 (maximum found). This count represents the total number of different additives used in a product's composition.
Examples of values: 3, 11, 6
Query examples:
# Find products with no additives:
SELECT code, product_name FROM products WHERE additives_n = 0
# Get distribution of products by number of additives:
SELECT additives_n, COUNT(*) as product_count FROM products WHERE additives_n IS NOT NULL GROUP BY additives_n ORDER BY additives_n
# Find products with high number of additives (more than 10):
SELECT code, product_name, additives_n FROM products WHERE additives_n > 10 ORDER BY additives_n DESC
# Calculate percentage of products with and without additives:
SELECT ROUND(COUNT(CASE WHEN additives_n = 0 THEN 1 END) * 100.0 / COUNT(*), 2) as percent_no_additives, ROUND(COUNT(CASE WHEN additives_n > 0 THEN 1 END) * 100.0 / COUNT(*), 2) as percent_with_additives FROM products WHERE additives_n IS NOT NULL

Column: additives_tags
Type: VARCHAR[]
Description: An array of food additives present in the product, using standardized E-number format with 'en:e' prefix. Each element represents one additive (e.g., 'en:e330' for citric acid). Common additives include preservatives, emulsifiers, and acidity regulators.
Examples of values: ['en:e330', 'en:e322', 'en:e500'], ['en:e211'], ['en:e330', 'en:e202', 'en:e260', 'en:e951']
Query examples:
# Find the most commonly used additives and their frequency:
WITH unnested AS ( SELECT unnest(additives_tags) as additive FROM products WHERE additives_tags IS NOT NULL ) SELECT additive, COUNT(*) as frequency FROM unnested GROUP BY additive ORDER BY frequency DESC LIMIT 10;
# Find products containing a specific additive (e.g., E330 - Citric acid):
SELECT code, product_name, additives_tags FROM products WHERE array_contains(additives_tags, 'en:e330') LIMIT 1000;
# Count products by number of additives used:
SELECT array_length(additives_tags) as num_additives, COUNT(*) as product_count FROM products WHERE additives_tags IS NOT NULL GROUP BY array_length(additives_tags) ORDER BY num_additives;

Column: ingredients_with_unspecified_percent_n
Type: INTEGER
Description: Counts the number of ingredients in a product that don't have their percentages specified. This metric is important for assessing product transparency and data completeness in ingredient listings.
Examples of values: 5, 44, 271
Query examples:
# Find products with the highest number of unspecified ingredient percentages, which might need attention for transparency improvement:
SELECT code, product_name, ingredients_with_unspecified_percent_n FROM products WHERE ingredients_with_unspecified_percent_n > 50 ORDER BY ingredients_with_unspecified_percent_n DESC LIMIT 1000;
# Analyze the distribution of products based on their number of unspecified ingredients to understand overall transparency levels:
SELECT CASE WHEN ingredients_with_unspecified_percent_n <= 10 THEN '1-10' WHEN ingredients_with_unspecified_percent_n <= 20 THEN '11-20' WHEN ingredients_with_unspecified_percent_n <= 30 THEN '21-30' ELSE 'Over 30' END as range, COUNT(*) as count FROM products WHERE ingredients_with_unspecified_percent_n IS NOT NULL GROUP BY 1 ORDER BY 1;
# Identify products where all ingredients lack percentage specifications, calculated as a ratio of unspecified to total ingredients:
SELECT code, product_name, ingredients_with_unspecified_percent_n, ingredients_n, ROUND(CAST(ingredients_with_unspecified_percent_n AS FLOAT) / NULLIF(ingredients_n, 0) * 100, 2) as unspecified_percentage FROM products WHERE ingredients_with_unspecified_percent_n > 0 AND ingredients_n > 0 ORDER BY unspecified_percentage DESC LIMIT 1000;

POTENTIALLY RELEVANT COLUMNS:
The following columns have been identified through semantic search as potentially relevant, 
with their similarity scores (higher means more likely relevant):

Column: categories
Type: VARCHAR
Description: A hierarchical classification of products using comma-separated category paths. Categories can be multiple levels deep and appear in different languages (primarily English and French). Each path typically goes from broad to specific categories (e.g., 'Snacks,Sweet snacks,Biscuits and cakes').
Examples of values: Sweeteners,Syrups,Simple syrups,Agave syrups, Plant-based beverages,Fruit-based,Juices and nectars,Fruit juices,Lemon juice, Snacks,Sweet snacks,Biscuits and cakes,Cakes
Query examples:
# Find products in a specific category (using LIKE pattern matching):
SELECT code, product_name, categories FROM products WHERE categories LIKE '%Snacks%' LIMIT 1000
# Count products by top-level category (first category in path):
SELECT TRIM(SPLIT_PART(categories, ',', 1)) as main_category, COUNT(*) as product_count FROM products WHERE categories IS NOT NULL GROUP BY TRIM(SPLIT_PART(categories, ',', 1)) ORDER BY product_count DESC LIMIT 1000
# Find products with the most detailed categorization (most category levels):
SELECT code, categories, LENGTH(categories) - LENGTH(REPLACE(categories, ',', '')) + 1 as category_depth FROM products WHERE categories IS NOT NULL ORDER BY category_depth DESC LIMIT 1000

Column: ingredients_original_tags
Type: VARCHAR[]
Description: An array of standardized ingredient tags, typically prefixed with language codes (e.g., 'en:', 'fr:'). Each tag represents a single ingredient in its normalized form, making it easier to search and analyze product compositions. The tags follow the Open Food Facts taxonomy.
Examples of values: ['en:water', 'en:sugar', 'en:carbon-dioxide'], ['en:fortified-wheat-flour', 'en:sugar', 'en:vegetable-oil', 'en:salt'], ['en:milk-chocolate', 'en:sugar', 'en:cocoa-butter', 'en:cocoa-paste', 'en:milk-powder']
Query examples:
# Find the most common ingredients in products and their frequency of use:
SELECT unnest(ingredients_original_tags) as ingredient, COUNT(*) as frequency FROM products WHERE ingredients_original_tags IS NOT NULL GROUP BY ingredient ORDER BY frequency DESC LIMIT 1000;
# Find all products containing a specific ingredient (e.g., sugar):
SELECT code, product_name, ingredients_original_tags FROM products WHERE array_contains(ingredients_original_tags, 'en:sugar') LIMIT 1000;
# Find products with the most ingredients, sorted by ingredient count:
SELECT code, product_name, array_length(ingredients_original_tags) as ingredient_count, ingredients_original_tags FROM products WHERE ingredients_original_tags IS NOT NULL ORDER BY array_length(ingredients_original_tags) DESC LIMIT 1000;

Column: food_groups_tags
Type: VARCHAR[]
Description: An array of food group tags that categorize products in a hierarchical structure. Each tag typically starts with 'en:' and represents different levels of food categorization, from broad categories (like 'beverages') to specific subcategories (like 'artificially-sweetened-beverages').
Examples of values: ['en:beverages', 'en:artificially-sweetened-beverages'], ['en:cereals-and-potatoes', 'en:bread'], ['en:fish-meat-eggs', 'en:meat', 'en:poultry']
Query examples:
# Get the distribution of top-level food groups with their product counts:
SELECT food_groups_tags[1] as main_group, COUNT(*) as product_count FROM products WHERE ARRAY_LENGTH(food_groups_tags) > 0 GROUP BY main_group ORDER BY product_count DESC LIMIT 1000
# Find products that belong to multiple food group categories (have detailed classification):
SELECT code, food_groups_tags FROM products WHERE ARRAY_LENGTH(food_groups_tags) > 2 ORDER BY ARRAY_LENGTH(food_groups_tags) DESC LIMIT 1000
# Find products in a specific food category and its subcategories:
SELECT code, food_groups_tags FROM products WHERE food_groups_tags[1] = 'en:beverages' AND ARRAY_LENGTH(food_groups_tags) > 1 LIMIT 1000

Column: unknown_ingredients_n
Type: INTEGER
Description: Count of ingredients in the product that are not recognized or cannot be properly classified in the Open Food Facts database
Examples of values: 0, 1, 15
Query examples:
# Find products with a high number of unknown ingredients (more than 10):
SELECT code, product_name, unknown_ingredients_n FROM products WHERE unknown_ingredients_n > 10 ORDER BY unknown_ingredients_n DESC LIMIT 50
# Calculate the percentage of products with unknown ingredients:
SELECT ROUND(COUNT(CASE WHEN unknown_ingredients_n > 0 THEN 1 END) * 100.0 / COUNT(*), 2) as percent_with_unknown FROM products WHERE unknown_ingredients_n IS NOT NULL LIMIT 50
# Group products by ranges of unknown ingredients count:
SELECT CASE WHEN unknown_ingredients_n = 0 THEN 'No unknown' WHEN unknown_ingredients_n BETWEEN 1 AND 5 THEN '1-5' WHEN unknown_ingredients_n BETWEEN 6 AND 10 THEN '6-10' ELSE 'More than 10' END as range, COUNT(*) as count FROM products WHERE unknown_ingredients_n IS NOT NULL GROUP BY 1 LIMIT 50

Column: categories_tags
Type: VARCHAR[]
Description: An array of category tags that classify the product in a hierarchical system. Tags use prefixes like 'en:' for English categories and follow a general-to-specific pattern (e.g., 'en:plant-based-foods-and-beverages' -> 'en:beverages'). Each product can have multiple categories, representing various aspects like food type, processing method, dietary restrictions, and certifications.
Examples of values: ['en:plant-based-foods-and-beverages', 'en:beverages', 'en:plant-based-beverages', 'en:coconut-milks'], ['en:snacks', 'en:sweet-snacks', 'en:cocoa-and-chocolate-products', 'en:chocolates'], ['en:dairies', 'en:milk', 'en:whole-milk']
Query examples:
# Count the number of products in each category to identify most common categories:
SELECT unnested_category, COUNT(*) as product_count FROM products, UNNEST(categories_tags) as unnested_category GROUP BY unnested_category ORDER BY product_count DESC LIMIT 1000;
# Find all products in a specific category (e.g., plant-based foods):
SELECT code, product_name, categories_tags FROM products WHERE array_contains(categories_tags, 'en:plant-based-foods-and-beverages') LIMIT 1000;
# Find products with the most detailed categorization (highest number of categories):
SELECT code, product_name, array_length(categories_tags) as category_count, categories_tags FROM products WHERE categories_tags IS NOT NULL ORDER BY array_length(categories_tags) DESC LIMIT 1000;

POTENTIALLY RELEVANT COLUMNS:
The following columns have been identified through semantic search as potentially relevant, 
with their similarity scores (higher means more likely relevant):

Column: product_name
Type: STRUCT(lang VARCHAR, text VARCHAR)[]
Description: Multilingual product names stored as an array of structures containing language code ('lang') and product name ('text'). Each product typically has a main name and translations in different languages (mainly English and French for the Canadian database).
Examples of values: [{'lang': 'main', 'text': 'Organic Vermont Maple Syrup'}, {'lang': 'fr', 'text': '100 pure vermont organic maple syrup'}], [{'lang': 'main', 'text': 'Fresh udon bowl'}, {'lang': 'fr', 'text': 'Fresh udon bowl'}], [{'lang': 'main', 'text': '1% low-fat milk'}, {'lang': 'en', 'text': '1% low-fat milk'}]
Query examples:
# Find products with multiple language translations (more than one name):
SELECT code, product_name FROM products WHERE ARRAY_LENGTH(product_name) > 1 LIMIT 50
# Get French product names where available:
SELECT code, UNNEST(LIST_FILTER(product_name, x -> x.lang = 'fr')).text AS french_name FROM products WHERE LIST_FILTER(product_name, x -> x.lang = 'fr') IS NOT NULL LIMIT 50
# Analyze translation coverage by counting products with different numbers of translations:
SELECT ARRAY_LENGTH(product_name) as translation_count, COUNT(*) as product_count FROM products WHERE product_name IS NOT NULL GROUP BY ARRAY_LENGTH(product_name) ORDER BY translation_count LIMIT 50

Column: brands
Type: VARCHAR
Description: The brand name(s) of the product. Can contain multiple brands separated by commas, often including bilingual versions (English/French) for Canadian products. Common for store brands and major manufacturers.
Examples of values: Compliments, No Name, Sans nom, President's Choice,Le choix du président
Query examples:
# Find the most common brands and their product counts:
SELECT brands, COUNT(*) as product_count FROM products WHERE brands IS NOT NULL GROUP BY brands ORDER BY product_count DESC LIMIT 1000;
# Find products with multiple brands (typically bilingual versions):
SELECT brands, COUNT(*) as count FROM products WHERE brands LIKE '%,%' GROUP BY brands ORDER BY count DESC LIMIT 1000;
# Search for products by a specific brand (case-insensitive):
SELECT code, brands FROM products WHERE LOWER(brands) LIKE LOWER('%Nestlé%') LIMIT 1000;

Column: labels
Type: VARCHAR
Description: A comma-separated list of product labels, certifications, and characteristics. Includes various food claims such as organic certification, dietary restrictions (gluten-free, vegan), and product certifications (Non-GMO, Kosher). Labels can appear in multiple languages (English, French) and may include standardized certifications.
Examples of values: No artificial flavors, No colorings, Organic, Kosher, Canada Organic, COR Kosher, Végétarien, Sans OGM, Végétalien, en:Non GMO project
Query examples:
# Find the most common product labels and their frequency:
WITH split_labels AS ( SELECT unnest(string_split(labels, ',')) as label FROM products WHERE labels IS NOT NULL ) SELECT trim(label) as label, COUNT(*) as count FROM split_labels GROUP BY label ORDER BY count DESC LIMIT 50
# Find products with specific certifications (e.g., organic and non-GMO):
SELECT code, product_name, labels FROM products WHERE labels ILIKE '%organic%' AND labels ILIKE '%non gmo%' LIMIT 50
# Count products by number of labels they have:
SELECT array_length(string_split(labels, ',')) as label_count, COUNT(*) as product_count FROM products WHERE labels IS NOT NULL GROUP BY label_count ORDER BY label_count LIMIT 50

Column: ingredients_text
Type: STRUCT(lang VARCHAR, text VARCHAR)[]
Description: Multi-language ingredient lists for products. Each entry in the array contains a language identifier and the corresponding ingredients text in that language. Common languages include 'en' (English), 'fr' (French), and 'main' (primary language).
Examples of values: [{'lang': 'en', 'text': 'Pure organic maple syrup'}, {'lang': 'main', 'text': 'Pure organic maple syrup'}], [{'lang': 'en', 'text': 'water, sugar, propylene glycol caramel color, ethyl vanillin, artificial flavor'}], [{'lang': 'en', 'text': 'lowfat milk, vitamin A palmitate, vitamin D3'}, {'lang': 'fr', 'text': 'lait faible en gras, palmitate de vitamine A, vitamine D3'}]
Query examples:
# Get product ingredients in English, falling back to main language if English is not available:
SELECT code, COALESCE( UNNEST(LIST_FILTER(ingredients_text, x -> x.lang = 'en'))['text'], UNNEST(LIST_FILTER(ingredients_text, x -> x.lang = 'main'))['text'] ) AS ingredients FROM products WHERE ingredients_text IS NOT NULL LIMIT 1000;
# Get products with ingredients in both English and French:
SELECT code, UNNEST(LIST_FILTER(ingredients_text, x -> x.lang = 'en'))['text'] as en_ingredients, UNNEST(LIST_FILTER(ingredients_text, x -> x.lang = 'fr'))['text'] as fr_ingredients FROM products WHERE ingredients_text IS NOT NULL AND EXISTS ( SELECT 1 FROM UNNEST(ingredients_text) t WHERE t.lang = 'en' ) AND EXISTS ( SELECT 1 FROM UNNEST(ingredients_text) t WHERE t.lang = 'fr' ) LIMIT 1000;
# Count number of products with missing ingredients text:
SELECT COUNT(*) as total_products, COUNT(CASE WHEN ingredients_text IS NULL THEN 1 END) as missing_ingredients, ROUND(COUNT(CASE WHEN ingredients_text IS NULL THEN 1 END) * 100.0 / COUNT(*), 2) as missing_percentage FROM products;

Column: food_groups_tags
Type: VARCHAR[]
Description: An array of food group tags that categorize products in a hierarchical structure. Each tag typically starts with 'en:' and represents different levels of food categorization, from broad categories (like 'beverages') to specific subcategories (like 'artificially-sweetened-beverages').
Examples of values: ['en:beverages', 'en:artificially-sweetened-beverages'], ['en:cereals-and-potatoes', 'en:bread'], ['en:fish-meat-eggs', 'en:meat', 'en:poultry']
Query examples:
# Get the distribution of top-level food groups with their product counts:
SELECT food_groups_tags[1] as main_group, COUNT(*) as product_count FROM products WHERE ARRAY_LENGTH(food_groups_tags) > 0 GROUP BY main_group ORDER BY product_count DESC LIMIT 1000
# Find products that belong to multiple food group categories (have detailed classification):
SELECT code, food_groups_tags FROM products WHERE ARRAY_LENGTH(food_groups_tags) > 2 ORDER BY ARRAY_LENGTH(food_groups_tags) DESC LIMIT 1000
# Find products in a specific food category and its subcategories:
SELECT code, food_groups_tags FROM products WHERE food_groups_tags[1] = 'en:beverages' AND ARRAY_LENGTH(food_groups_tags) > 1 LIMIT 1000

POTENTIALLY RELEVANT COLUMNS:
The following columns have been identified through semantic search as potentially relevant, 
with their similarity scores (higher means more likely relevant):

Column: food_groups_tags
Type: VARCHAR[]
Description: An array of food group tags that categorize products in a hierarchical structure. Each tag typically starts with 'en:' and represents different levels of food categorization, from broad categories (like 'beverages') to specific subcategories (like 'artificially-sweetened-beverages').
Examples of values: ['en:beverages', 'en:artificially-sweetened-beverages'], ['en:cereals-and-potatoes', 'en:bread'], ['en:fish-meat-eggs', 'en:meat', 'en:poultry']
Query examples:
# Get the distribution of top-level food groups with their product counts:
SELECT food_groups_tags[1] as main_group, COUNT(*) as product_count FROM products WHERE ARRAY_LENGTH(food_groups_tags) > 0 GROUP BY main_group ORDER BY product_count DESC LIMIT 1000
# Find products that belong to multiple food group categories (have detailed classification):
SELECT code, food_groups_tags FROM products WHERE ARRAY_LENGTH(food_groups_tags) > 2 ORDER BY ARRAY_LENGTH(food_groups_tags) DESC LIMIT 1000
# Find products in a specific food category and its subcategories:
SELECT code, food_groups_tags FROM products WHERE food_groups_tags[1] = 'en:beverages' AND ARRAY_LENGTH(food_groups_tags) > 1 LIMIT 1000

Column: categories
Type: VARCHAR
Description: A hierarchical classification of products using comma-separated category paths. Categories can be multiple levels deep and appear in different languages (primarily English and French). Each path typically goes from broad to specific categories (e.g., 'Snacks,Sweet snacks,Biscuits and cakes').
Examples of values: Sweeteners,Syrups,Simple syrups,Agave syrups, Plant-based beverages,Fruit-based,Juices and nectars,Fruit juices,Lemon juice, Snacks,Sweet snacks,Biscuits and cakes,Cakes
Query examples:
# Find products in a specific category (using LIKE pattern matching):
SELECT code, product_name, categories FROM products WHERE categories LIKE '%Snacks%' LIMIT 1000
# Count products by top-level category (first category in path):
SELECT TRIM(SPLIT_PART(categories, ',', 1)) as main_category, COUNT(*) as product_count FROM products WHERE categories IS NOT NULL GROUP BY TRIM(SPLIT_PART(categories, ',', 1)) ORDER BY product_count DESC LIMIT 1000
# Find products with the most detailed categorization (most category levels):
SELECT code, categories, LENGTH(categories) - LENGTH(REPLACE(categories, ',', '')) + 1 as category_depth FROM products WHERE categories IS NOT NULL ORDER BY category_depth DESC LIMIT 1000

Column: categories_tags
Type: VARCHAR[]
Description: An array of category tags that classify the product in a hierarchical system. Tags use prefixes like 'en:' for English categories and follow a general-to-specific pattern (e.g., 'en:plant-based-foods-and-beverages' -> 'en:beverages'). Each product can have multiple categories, representing various aspects like food type, processing method, dietary restrictions, and certifications.
Examples of values: ['en:plant-based-foods-and-beverages', 'en:beverages', 'en:plant-based-beverages', 'en:coconut-milks'], ['en:snacks', 'en:sweet-snacks', 'en:cocoa-and-chocolate-products', 'en:chocolates'], ['en:dairies', 'en:milk', 'en:whole-milk']
Query examples:
# Count the number of products in each category to identify most common categories:
SELECT unnested_category, COUNT(*) as product_count FROM products, UNNEST(categories_tags) as unnested_category GROUP BY unnested_category ORDER BY product_count DESC LIMIT 1000;
# Find all products in a specific category (e.g., plant-based foods):
SELECT code, product_name, categories_tags FROM products WHERE array_contains(categories_tags, 'en:plant-based-foods-and-beverages') LIMIT 1000;
# Find products with the most detailed categorization (highest number of categories):
SELECT code, product_name, array_length(categories_tags) as category_count, categories_tags FROM products WHERE categories_tags IS NOT NULL ORDER BY array_length(categories_tags) DESC LIMIT 1000;

Column: ciqual_food_name_tags
Type: VARCHAR[]
Description: An array of standardized CIQUAL (French food composition database) food category tags that classify the product. These tags provide hierarchical food categorization and are used for nutritional analysis and product classification. Although it's an array type, products typically have only one category tag.
Examples of values: non-alcoholic-beverage-average, ketchup, pastry-cream-puff
Query examples:
# Find the distribution of CIQUAL food categories, showing the most common categories:
SELECT ciqual_food_name_tags[1] as category, COUNT(*) as count FROM products WHERE ciqual_food_name_tags IS NOT NULL GROUP BY category ORDER BY count DESC LIMIT 1000
# Find products that have a specific CIQUAL food category (e.g., 'bread-average'):
SELECT code, product_name, ciqual_food_name_tags FROM products WHERE ciqual_food_name_tags[1] = 'bread-average' LIMIT 1000
# Search for products with CIQUAL categories containing specific keywords (e.g., 'cheese'):
SELECT code, product_name, ciqual_food_name_tags FROM products WHERE array_contains(array_transform(ciqual_food_name_tags, x -> contains(x, 'cheese')), true) LIMIT 1000

Column: ingredients_original_tags
Type: VARCHAR[]
Description: An array of standardized ingredient tags, typically prefixed with language codes (e.g., 'en:', 'fr:'). Each tag represents a single ingredient in its normalized form, making it easier to search and analyze product compositions. The tags follow the Open Food Facts taxonomy.
Examples of values: ['en:water', 'en:sugar', 'en:carbon-dioxide'], ['en:fortified-wheat-flour', 'en:sugar', 'en:vegetable-oil', 'en:salt'], ['en:milk-chocolate', 'en:sugar', 'en:cocoa-butter', 'en:cocoa-paste', 'en:milk-powder']
Query examples:
# Find the most common ingredients in products and their frequency of use:
SELECT unnest(ingredients_original_tags) as ingredient, COUNT(*) as frequency FROM products WHERE ingredients_original_tags IS NOT NULL GROUP BY ingredient ORDER BY frequency DESC LIMIT 1000;
# Find all products containing a specific ingredient (e.g., sugar):
SELECT code, product_name, ingredients_original_tags FROM products WHERE array_contains(ingredients_original_tags, 'en:sugar') LIMIT 1000;
# Find products with the most ingredients, sorted by ingredient count:
SELECT code, product_name, array_length(ingredients_original_tags) as ingredient_count, ingredients_original_tags FROM products WHERE ingredients_original_tags IS NOT NULL ORDER BY array_length(ingredients_original_tags) DESC LIMIT 1000;

POTENTIALLY RELEVANT COLUMNS:
The following columns have been identified through semantic search as potentially relevant, 
with their similarity scores (higher means more likely relevant):

Column: food_groups_tags
Type: VARCHAR[]
Description: An array of food group tags that categorize products in a hierarchical structure. Each tag typically starts with 'en:' and represents different levels of food categorization, from broad categories (like 'beverages') to specific subcategories (like 'artificially-sweetened-beverages').
Examples of values: ['en:beverages', 'en:artificially-sweetened-beverages'], ['en:cereals-and-potatoes', 'en:bread'], ['en:fish-meat-eggs', 'en:meat', 'en:poultry']
Query examples:
# Get the distribution of top-level food groups with their product counts:
SELECT food_groups_tags[1] as main_group, COUNT(*) as product_count FROM products WHERE ARRAY_LENGTH(food_groups_tags) > 0 GROUP BY main_group ORDER BY product_count DESC LIMIT 1000
# Find products that belong to multiple food group categories (have detailed classification):
SELECT code, food_groups_tags FROM products WHERE ARRAY_LENGTH(food_groups_tags) > 2 ORDER BY ARRAY_LENGTH(food_groups_tags) DESC LIMIT 1000
# Find products in a specific food category and its subcategories:
SELECT code, food_groups_tags FROM products WHERE food_groups_tags[1] = 'en:beverages' AND ARRAY_LENGTH(food_groups_tags) > 1 LIMIT 1000

Column: categories
Type: VARCHAR
Description: A hierarchical classification of products using comma-separated category paths. Categories can be multiple levels deep and appear in different languages (primarily English and French). Each path typically goes from broad to specific categories (e.g., 'Snacks,Sweet snacks,Biscuits and cakes').
Examples of values: Sweeteners,Syrups,Simple syrups,Agave syrups, Plant-based beverages,Fruit-based,Juices and nectars,Fruit juices,Lemon juice, Snacks,Sweet snacks,Biscuits and cakes,Cakes
Query examples:
# Find products in a specific category (using LIKE pattern matching):
SELECT code, product_name, categories FROM products WHERE categories LIKE '%Snacks%' LIMIT 1000
# Count products by top-level category (first category in path):
SELECT TRIM(SPLIT_PART(categories, ',', 1)) as main_category, COUNT(*) as product_count FROM products WHERE categories IS NOT NULL GROUP BY TRIM(SPLIT_PART(categories, ',', 1)) ORDER BY product_count DESC LIMIT 1000
# Find products with the most detailed categorization (most category levels):
SELECT code, categories, LENGTH(categories) - LENGTH(REPLACE(categories, ',', '')) + 1 as category_depth FROM products WHERE categories IS NOT NULL ORDER BY category_depth DESC LIMIT 1000

Column: unknown_ingredients_n
Type: INTEGER
Description: Count of ingredients in the product that are not recognized or cannot be properly classified in the Open Food Facts database
Examples of values: 0, 1, 15
Query examples:
# Find products with a high number of unknown ingredients (more than 10):
SELECT code, product_name, unknown_ingredients_n FROM products WHERE unknown_ingredients_n > 10 ORDER BY unknown_ingredients_n DESC LIMIT 50
# Calculate the percentage of products with unknown ingredients:
SELECT ROUND(COUNT(CASE WHEN unknown_ingredients_n > 0 THEN 1 END) * 100.0 / COUNT(*), 2) as percent_with_unknown FROM products WHERE unknown_ingredients_n IS NOT NULL LIMIT 50
# Group products by ranges of unknown ingredients count:
SELECT CASE WHEN unknown_ingredients_n = 0 THEN 'No unknown' WHEN unknown_ingredients_n BETWEEN 1 AND 5 THEN '1-5' WHEN unknown_ingredients_n BETWEEN 6 AND 10 THEN '6-10' ELSE 'More than 10' END as range, COUNT(*) as count FROM products WHERE unknown_ingredients_n IS NOT NULL GROUP BY 1 LIMIT 50

Column: ingredients_original_tags
Type: VARCHAR[]
Description: An array of standardized ingredient tags, typically prefixed with language codes (e.g., 'en:', 'fr:'). Each tag represents a single ingredient in its normalized form, making it easier to search and analyze product compositions. The tags follow the Open Food Facts taxonomy.
Examples of values: ['en:water', 'en:sugar', 'en:carbon-dioxide'], ['en:fortified-wheat-flour', 'en:sugar', 'en:vegetable-oil', 'en:salt'], ['en:milk-chocolate', 'en:sugar', 'en:cocoa-butter', 'en:cocoa-paste', 'en:milk-powder']
Query examples:
# Find the most common ingredients in products and their frequency of use:
SELECT unnest(ingredients_original_tags) as ingredient, COUNT(*) as frequency FROM products WHERE ingredients_original_tags IS NOT NULL GROUP BY ingredient ORDER BY frequency DESC LIMIT 1000;
# Find all products containing a specific ingredient (e.g., sugar):
SELECT code, product_name, ingredients_original_tags FROM products WHERE array_contains(ingredients_original_tags, 'en:sugar') LIMIT 1000;
# Find products with the most ingredients, sorted by ingredient count:
SELECT code, product_name, array_length(ingredients_original_tags) as ingredient_count, ingredients_original_tags FROM products WHERE ingredients_original_tags IS NOT NULL ORDER BY array_length(ingredients_original_tags) DESC LIMIT 1000;

Column: categories_tags
Type: VARCHAR[]
Description: An array of category tags that classify the product in a hierarchical system. Tags use prefixes like 'en:' for English categories and follow a general-to-specific pattern (e.g., 'en:plant-based-foods-and-beverages' -> 'en:beverages'). Each product can have multiple categories, representing various aspects like food type, processing method, dietary restrictions, and certifications.
Examples of values: ['en:plant-based-foods-and-beverages', 'en:beverages', 'en:plant-based-beverages', 'en:coconut-milks'], ['en:snacks', 'en:sweet-snacks', 'en:cocoa-and-chocolate-products', 'en:chocolates'], ['en:dairies', 'en:milk', 'en:whole-milk']
Query examples:
# Count the number of products in each category to identify most common categories:
SELECT unnested_category, COUNT(*) as product_count FROM products, UNNEST(categories_tags) as unnested_category GROUP BY unnested_category ORDER BY product_count DESC LIMIT 1000;
# Find all products in a specific category (e.g., plant-based foods):
SELECT code, product_name, categories_tags FROM products WHERE array_contains(categories_tags, 'en:plant-based-foods-and-beverages') LIMIT 1000;
# Find products with the most detailed categorization (highest number of categories):
SELECT code, product_name, array_length(categories_tags) as category_count, categories_tags FROM products WHERE categories_tags IS NOT NULL ORDER BY array_length(categories_tags) DESC LIMIT 1000;

POTENTIALLY RELEVANT COLUMNS:
The following columns have been identified through semantic search as potentially relevant, 
with their similarity scores (higher means more likely relevant):

Column: ingredients_without_ciqual_codes_n
Type: INTEGER
Description: Count of ingredients in the product that do not have associated CIQUAL codes. CIQUAL codes are standardized references used in food composition databases. This metric indicates how many ingredients in a product lack standardized classification.
Examples of values: 0, 1, 136
Query examples:
# Get distribution of products by number of ingredients without CIQUAL codes:
SELECT ingredients_without_ciqual_codes_n, COUNT(*) as product_count FROM products WHERE ingredients_without_ciqual_codes_n IS NOT NULL GROUP BY ingredients_without_ciqual_codes_n ORDER BY ingredients_without_ciqual_codes_n
# Find products with unusually high number of uncoded ingredients (more than 50):
SELECT code, product_name, ingredients_without_ciqual_codes_n FROM products WHERE ingredients_without_ciqual_codes_n > 50 ORDER BY ingredients_without_ciqual_codes_n DESC
# Calculate data completeness statistics for this field:
SELECT COUNT(*) as total_products, COUNT(ingredients_without_ciqual_codes_n) as products_with_data, ROUND(COUNT(ingredients_without_ciqual_codes_n) * 100.0 / COUNT(*), 2) as completion_rate FROM products

Column: ciqual_food_name_tags
Type: VARCHAR[]
Description: An array of standardized CIQUAL (French food composition database) food category tags that classify the product. These tags provide hierarchical food categorization and are used for nutritional analysis and product classification. Although it's an array type, products typically have only one category tag.
Examples of values: non-alcoholic-beverage-average, ketchup, pastry-cream-puff
Query examples:
# Find the distribution of CIQUAL food categories, showing the most common categories:
SELECT ciqual_food_name_tags[1] as category, COUNT(*) as count FROM products WHERE ciqual_food_name_tags IS NOT NULL GROUP BY category ORDER BY count DESC LIMIT 1000
# Find products that have a specific CIQUAL food category (e.g., 'bread-average'):
SELECT code, product_name, ciqual_food_name_tags FROM products WHERE ciqual_food_name_tags[1] = 'bread-average' LIMIT 1000
# Search for products with CIQUAL categories containing specific keywords (e.g., 'cheese'):
SELECT code, product_name, ciqual_food_name_tags FROM products WHERE array_contains(array_transform(ciqual_food_name_tags, x -> contains(x, 'cheese')), true) LIMIT 1000

Column: ingredients_without_ciqual_codes
Type: VARCHAR[]
Description: An array of ingredients that don't have corresponding CIQUAL (French food composition database) codes. These ingredients are typically additives, processing aids, or specific ingredients that cannot be mapped to standard nutritional data. Each ingredient is prefixed with a language code (e.g., 'en:', 'fr:').
Examples of values: ['en:e300', 'en:vegetable-pigment', 'en:vitamin-c'], ['en:e202', 'en:e330'], ['en:colour', 'en:e341i', 'en:e500ii', 'en:wheat-gluten']
Query examples:
# Find products with the highest number of ingredients without CIQUAL codes:
SELECT code, ingredients_without_ciqual_codes, array_length(ingredients_without_ciqual_codes) as ingredient_count FROM products WHERE ingredients_without_ciqual_codes IS NOT NULL ORDER BY array_length(ingredients_without_ciqual_codes) DESC LIMIT 50
# Find products containing a specific additive (e.g., E300 - Vitamin C):
SELECT code, ingredients_without_ciqual_codes FROM products WHERE ingredients_without_ciqual_codes IS NOT NULL AND array_contains(ingredients_without_ciqual_codes, 'en:e300') LIMIT 50
# Count products with and without CIQUAL-mapped ingredients:
SELECT COUNT(CASE WHEN ingredients_without_ciqual_codes IS NOT NULL THEN 1 END) as with_non_ciqual, COUNT(CASE WHEN ingredients_without_ciqual_codes IS NULL THEN 1 END) as without_non_ciqual FROM products LIMIT 50

SEARCH SEQUENCE RULES:
1. ALWAYS start with database queries using the most relevant columns
2. If initial query fails, try alternative database queries with different columns or approaches
3. Only if database queries are unsuccessful, search the Canada Food Guide
4. Document EVERY attempt in the steps array, including failures
5. Never skip straight to Food Guide without trying database first
6. Always include the source of the information in the answer ("Open Food Facts" or "Canada Food Guide")
7. Always respond in the same language as the question (French or English)

RESPONSE FORMAT REQUIREMENTS:
1. Provide ONLY the natural language answer to the user's question
2. Maximum response length: 200 characters
3. DO NOT include SQL queries, code snippets, or technical details
4. DO NOT explain your reasoning or methodology
5. Respond in the same language as the question (French or English)
6. DO mention the source of information ("Open Food Facts" or "Canada Food Guide")

Please follow these rules to ensure a consistent and effective search strategy.
